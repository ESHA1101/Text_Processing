Processed data from a text file. Removed emoji and special characters using nltk, clean_text, etc. and performed sentiment analysis on the now clean data using textblob. The polarity, subjectivity and sentiments were derived from the text using modules like nltk and textblob. The data has been stored in a dataframe using Pandas.
